  <strong>Claude Code plugins that are better than NZT-48.</strong>
</p>

*Remember the movie? One pill and you're operating at 100% capacity — seeing patterns, making connections, executing at superhuman speed. These plugins are that pill for Claude Code.*

## What Is This?

A curated collection of Claude Code skills designed to unlock capabilities you didn't know you needed. Each plugin transforms Claude from an assistant into a specialist — researching, creating, and executing at a level that would normally take a team.

**The goal:** Make you (and Claude) limitless.

## Plugins

| [**magic-three**](plugins/magic-three/) | Pyro's essential agent skill trio: spec-driven development (OpenSpec), dependency-aware task management (Beads), and privacy-respecting web search (SearXNG). The structured development toolkit. |

## Philosophy

> "I don't have delusions of grandeur, I have an accurate assessment of my own abilities."
> — Eddie Morra, *Limitless*

These plugins embody:

- **Depth over breadth** — Each plugin does one thing exceptionally well
- **Research-first** — Don't just execute, understand first
- **Complete outputs** — No half-measures; if you're making an article, make the social kit too
- **Delightful surprises** — Dice-rolled podcast hosts, creative prose versions, unexpected depth

---

## Coming Soon

The roadmap includes plugins for:

- **deep-research** — Multi-source synthesis with citation tracking
- **codebase-oracle** — Instant deep understanding of any codebase
- **pitch-deck** — Investor-ready presentations from a business concept
- **data-story** — Charts, visualizations, and narratives from raw data
- **brand-forge** — Brand kits, style guides, design systems

See [docs/brainstorm/plugin-ideas.md](docs/brainstorm/plugin-ideas.md) for the full idea backlog.
