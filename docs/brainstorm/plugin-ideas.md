# Plugin Ideas Brainstorm

*Ideas for Limitless plugins — cognitive enhancement for Claude Code.*

Each plugin should answer: **"What would you do if you could do anything?"**

---

## Research & Knowledge

### 🔬 deep-research
**What it does:** Multi-source research synthesis with citation tracking. Takes a question, searches multiple sources (web, academic papers, docs), cross-references findings, identifies consensus vs controversy, and produces a comprehensive research brief with proper citations.

**Why it fits:** The Limitless character could absorb and synthesize information from countless sources instantly. This plugin gives that superpower — turn "I wonder about X" into "Here's everything known about X, synthesized."

---

### 📚 codebase-oracle
**What it does:** Instant deep understanding of any codebase. Analyzes architecture, patterns, dependencies, data flow, and conventions. Produces navigable documentation, architecture diagrams, and answers questions like "How does auth work here?" or "Where would I add a new API endpoint?"

**Why it fits:** Walking into a new codebase is like walking into a room speaking a foreign language. This plugin is instant fluency — understand any codebase as if you wrote it.
